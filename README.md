# System-Integretion-and-Architecture
What I expect from our subject System Integration and Architecture,  is to learn and  deepen my understanding on how principles behind System Integration and System Architecture works. With the help of our subject, I want to learn how complex systems are built, designed, and made to work together seamlessly. Also, I expect to learn how different components are made to make a unified solutions. 

I'm hoping to acquire so many things from our subject, specially I want to learn and gain skills that would help me to improve as an IT student. As of right now I know I don't know much but I want to learn and use that knowledge today and in the near future. I hope that the things I would learn from this subject would not only help me, but also others.

After I take this subject, I hope my understanding about System Integration and Architecture were widened. I hope that the knowledge that I will get from this subject would help me to be more confident in taking challenges.
